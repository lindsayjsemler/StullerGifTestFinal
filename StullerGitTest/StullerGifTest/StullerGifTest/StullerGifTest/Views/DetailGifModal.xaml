        <!-- This does not work, turns out gifs do not animate in this old version of
            Xamarin Forms and was a known bug, in hindsight I should have implemented this both in iOS and
            Android since this seems to be and Android only bug! If I had the time to re-do the entire project
            and copy over everything, I would try that next and have this as an iOS only app instead of picking Android
            I am keeping IsAnimationPlaying="True" out of the image in hopes the image itself will show up.
            I have tried to add the image with and image source of the png as you can see in the GifModel, but
            that doesn't show up either! -->
